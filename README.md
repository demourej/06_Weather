# WEATHER DASHBOARD

## About the project

Weather Dashboard is a code to create an application that uses server side APIs from [OpenWeather Current API](https://openweathermap.org/current) and [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) for retrieving weather data for cities oriented to travelers who want to see the weather outlook at multiple cities so that they can plan a trip accordingly.

## Usage

To obtain a city weather information you just need to type the City Name you want to search and click on Search and Weather Dashboard will retrieve the weather data for today and the weather forecast for the following 5 days. Weather Dashbord will show you the following info: 

```
**City Name and Dates: Found city to find current and forecasted weather info.

**Icons: Current and next 5 days cards contains an icon whith dynamic graphical representation of weather condition for current moment and weather forecast.

**Temperature: Temperature measured with a thermometer refering to how hot or cold the atmosphere is at the found city reported in Celcius degrees scale.
